TASK 2:
A.	Create a GUI Application for student marks insertion and CGPA calculation

1. Create a tkinter based application consisting of a login page(Graphical User Interface) where you have two input ‘’User Name “ and “password ” and a submit button. On providing correct input and on clicking the submit button a new GUI (1) will open and on wrong input an error message box should pop up having the content “ Invalid username or password ”.

2. The GUI (1) should consist of three inputs “ Name ” , ”Branch ” and “Registration ID ” followed by a submit button. On clicking the submit button the data entered should be stored in a database (Using Mysql or Sqlite) and should also open another user interface GUI (2) . 
3. The GUI (2) should consist of minimum  of three buttons consisting of  subjects name (of your choice ) and on submit button . On clicking any of the subject button  an input user interface should appear where the user can input the marks . On clicking the submit button, the marks entered should get saved in the database on the same row of the  ‘username’ and ‘registration number’ entered earlier and  a new GUI(3) opens .
4.The GUI(3) should consist of four buttons “ CGPA” , “GRADE”, “New Input” and “ Close”.
On clicking ,
The CGPA button should show the CGPA(on the range of 10) based on the marks input.
The GRADE button should show the grade of the student (Ex: CGPA=10,Grade=O) 
The New Input button should reopen the GUI(1) and the process of insertion should continue.
The Close button should close all the existing GUIs.
